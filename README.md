# Angular Community

[![Discord][discord-badge]][discord-invite-url]

A community-ran Discord for all things Angular.

## About the Discord

Our Discord was formed to bring together the incredible Angular community. We
want a place where everyone is welcome at the click of a button. We see it being
the central location to connect Angular Team members, Google Developer Experts
(GDEs), library authors, meetup groups, and anyone using or is interested in
learning the framework.

[Click here][discord-invite-url] to be invited to the Discord.
